<p>Provides for predicates that map an object to <code>true</code> or <code>false</code>. A predicate encapsulates a unary function of type <code>Object -&gt; boolean</code>. Using a predicate, it is possible to reuse a function so that it can be passed to a method as an argument.</p>

<h2>Examples</h2>

<h3>Retrieving all wednesdays from a collection</h3>

<p>Suppose that I want to retrieve all wednesdays from a collection, and let's 
assume they are represented by a <code>Calendar</code> object with a <code>DAY_OF_WEEK</code> field that equals <code>Calendar.WEDNESDAY</code>.</p>

<p>Let's assume further that our collection contains other objects than <code>Calendar</code> objects, so that we know nothing about the type of the objects.</p>

<pre><code>
Collection myClone = new ArrayList(myCollection);
TotalPredicate isWednesday = new PrimitiveTotalPredicate() {
                public boolean eval(Object o) {
                  return (o instanceof Calendar) &amp;&amp; (((Calendar)o).DAY_OF_WEEK == Calendar.WEDNESDAY);
                }
  };
isWednesday.filter(myClone);
</code></pre>
<h3>Checking whether or not there is a party on wednesday</h3>
<p>Suppose I've got all days on which there is a party in a collection. Now I want to know whether or not there is a party on a wednesday. I can reuse the <code>isWednesday</code> predicate from above.</p>

<pre><code>
boolean partyOnWednesday = isWednesday.exists(partyDays);
</code></pre>
<h3>Parties not no a wednesday</h3>
<p>Now I want all parties that are not on a wednesday. Although the criterion is slightly different now, I can still reuse <code>isWednesday</code>. All I have to do is invert is with <a href="Not.html"><code>Not</code></a>.</p>

<pre><code>
Collection partiesNotOnWednesday = new ArrayList(partyDays);
new Not(isWednesday).filter(partiesNotOnWednesday);
</code></pre>
